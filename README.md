# OME WebRTC React Player

A simple React interface for testing **WebRTC playback via OvenMediaEngine (OME)**.

It allows you to:
- Enter the WebRTC stream URL (e.g. from OME Edge)
- Optionally provide a stream password
- Watch the stream using OvenPlayer

> The app is fully Dockerized. No Node.js or Yarn is required on the host machine.
